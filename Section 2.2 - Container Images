Creating and Managing Container Images:


What are images?
In Linux, everything is a file. The whole operating system is basically a
filesystem with files and folders stored on the local disk. This is an important
fact to remember when looking at what container images are.
As we will see, an image is basically a big tarball containing a filesystem.
More specifically, it contains a layered filesystem.

The layered filesystem
Container images are templates from which containers are created.
These images are not made up of just one monolithic block but are composed of
many layers. The first layer in the image is also called the base layer.

The layers of a container image are all immutable. Immutable means that once generated,
the layer cannot ever be changed. The only possible operation affecting the layer is its
physical deletion.

The writable container layer
As we have discussed, a container image is made of a stack of immutable or read-only layers.
When the Docker Engine creates a container from such an image, it adds a writable container
layer on top of this stack of immutable layers.
The Container Layer is marked as read/write.
